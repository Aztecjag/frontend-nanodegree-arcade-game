Get to the top of the board and avoid bumping into enemy bugs. Use the arrow keys to move the players. You can choose your player by selecting the radio button next to the player. Press the "Start/Reset" button to begin playing the game and also to reset it. The first timer keeps track of the "Total Time" and the second timer keeps track of the "Best Time" it took to win.
